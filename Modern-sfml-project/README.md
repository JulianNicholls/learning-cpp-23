# Learning C++

I first learnt C++ over 30 years ago, but C++ and I have moved on a lot in that time.

In 2025, I have re-ignited my interest in writing C++. I started with some Raylib tutorials from Youtube, and then completed two 
courses in modern C++ on Udemy [Learn Modern C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-intermediate-modern-c) 
and [Pure C++ 20](https://www.udemy.com/course/purecpp20).

After that, I embarked on my favourite application to write in a new language: [Hangman](https://github.com/JulianNicholls/hangman-cpp).
